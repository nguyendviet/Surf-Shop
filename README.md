# Surf-Shop

## Overview
A responsive website of an imaginary surf shop with main, shop, event and contact pages. All animations were built with **raw** HTML5 and CSS3.

### Why I built this website?
How far can you go with just HTML and CSS in order to build a responsive website? That inspired me to build this website and its animations.

### Demo
* GitHub IO: [Surf Shop](https://nguyendviet.github.io/Surf-Shop/)
